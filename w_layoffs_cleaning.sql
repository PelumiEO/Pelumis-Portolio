/* Create a CTE(Common Table Expression) 
A Common Table Expression (CTE) is a temporary result set in SQL that you can reference within a 
`SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` statement. 
It is defined using the `WITH` keyword, followed by a name and a query. 
CTEs are particularly useful for simplifying complex queries, improving readability, and breaking down queries into modular, understandable parts.

### Syntax
WITH cte_name AS (
    -- Your SQL query here
)
SELECT * FROM cte_name;

### Example
Hereâ€™s an example that uses a CTE to select from tables: employees(e) and their departments(d):
WITH EmployeeDepartment AS 
(
    SELECT e.EmployeeID, e.Name, d.DepartmentName
    FROM Employees e
    JOIN Departments d ON e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID
)
SELECT * FROM EmployeeDepartment;

In this example, `EmployeeDepartment` is the CTE that selects employees and their department names. The final `SELECT` statement then uses this CTE. */
